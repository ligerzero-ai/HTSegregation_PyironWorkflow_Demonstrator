# High-throughput Segregation Pyiron Workflow Demonstrator

High-throughput grain boundary segregation demonstrator using pyiron_workflow, pyiron_workflow_atomistics, and LAMMPS.

## Description

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating high-throughput grain boundary segregation calculations using the pyiron_workflow framework.

### Notebooks

1. **`grain_boundary_segregation.ipynb`**: Complete workflow for calculating grain boundary segregation energies, including:
   - Crystal structure optimization
   - Solution energy calculations
   - Grain boundary structure generation and analysis
   - Segregation energy calculations for individual elements

2. **`publication_example_dataset.ipynb`**: Analysis and visualization of publication data
   - Analyzes the comprehensive dataset from our published study in [Acta Materialia (2025), DOI: 10.1016/j.actamat.2025.121288](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2025.121288)
   - Reproduces all publication figures showing segregation and cohesion effects
   - Contains data for all periodic table elements at 6 CSL grain boundaries in Fe
   - Dataset generated using DFT (VASP) calculations with a workflow similar to `grain_boundary_segregation.ipynb`
   - Demonstrates analysis techniques for large-scale segregation datasets
   - Supplementary figures can be generated from the `SupplementaryFigures.ipynb` notebooks

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- pyiron-workflow-atomistics
- pyiron-workflow-lammps
- LAMMPS (from conda-forge)

## Local Installation

### Clone this Repository

To get started, first clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyiron/HTSegregation_PyironWorkflow_Demonstrator.git
cd HTSegregation_PyironWorkflow_Demonstrator
```

### Using Conda (Recommended)

Create the environment from the `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ht_segregation
```

### Using pip

Alternatively, install the required dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or with notebook support:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebook]"
```

## Usage

### Running the Workflow

Open and run the `grain_boundary_segregation.ipynb` notebook to execute the complete segregation workflow with LAMMPS calculations.

### Exploring Published Results

Open the `publication_example_dataset.ipynb` notebook to:
- Explore the comprehensive periodic table dataset
- Reproduce publication figures
- Analyze segregation trends across elements and GB types
